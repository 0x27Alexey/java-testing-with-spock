## Description

This GIT repository contains all source code for the book [Java Testing With Spock](http://manning.com/kapelonis/) published by Manning.
Each chapter is offered as an independent Maven project. 

## Free chapter
You can get an overview of Spock and read a brief discussion on its features in the first
chapter of the book. This chapter is [freely available](http://manning.com/kapelonis/JTwSpock_MEAP_ch1.pdf) in PDF format.

## Requirements
To use the code samples you need the following:
* Java Development Kit version 7+
* Maven installed (**mvn** should be available in the command line)
* Internet access (for fetching library dependencies)


## Usage

You can checkout/run any chapter on its own. For each chapter entering the command
**mvn test** will compile and run all JUnit/Spock tests
